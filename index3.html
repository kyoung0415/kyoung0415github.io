       My project consists of three pictures that use various backgrounds, props, angles, and appearance.  For my first picture, I draped a bright yellow background over the back of my shadow box. The yellow made the brown cupcake pop because of the contrast in color. In addition, I placed the cupcake on a blue stool to incorporate more color and to lift the cupcake off the ground. The angle used was eye level. For the second picture, I placed the cupcake on a wood and marble cutting board, which gave a clean look and the angle used was bird's eye. For the third picture, I draped an orange background over the back of my shadow box to make the cupcake pop and I placed the cupcake on a blue stool to introduce a new color and to lift the cupcake off the ground. For all three picture, I placed the lights on the left and right sides of my shadow box, which gave off an illuminating background. For the first picture, I mainly brightened the picture and deepened the contrast. For the second, I again heightened the brightness and deepened the contrast to darken the color of the wood and lighten the color of the frosting. I also slightly cropped the right side of the picture, in order to remove an unwanted counter peeking through.  I did not edit the last picture because I thought it was a masterpiece.  I did not heavily edit any of the pictures because I thought the pictures looked decent by themselves. I think for this project my area of expertise was using the lights to illuminate the background. As shown above in picture number, the orange background is glowing from the genius light placement. I also excelled at finding interesting backgrounds to enhance the delicious characteristics of the cupcake. I don't think I edited very well, but I also didn't edit very much at all. In addition,  I do not think I used my camera settings to the best of my abilities because I only used on setting, which was manual mode.
